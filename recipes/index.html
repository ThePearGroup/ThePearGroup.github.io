    <center><h2>Classic Carrot Cake</h2></center>
<p> An homage to tradition and familial bonds, enriched with the natural sweetness of carrots
    and a crunch of walnuts, it holds a special place in his heart as it was his late grandfather's favorite. Every year on
    his grandfather's birthday, Denzel bakes this cake to honor his memory and the bond they shared over the love of
    baking.</p>
<p> Ingredients: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 2 teaspoons cinnamon,
    1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 cup vegetable oil, 4 large eggs, 2 cups grated carrots, 1 cup crushed pineapple, 1/2 cup
    chopped walnuts.</p>    
<p> Instructions: First, preheat the oven to 350°F. Next, mix together the flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a large
    bowl. Then, stir in the oil and eggs until smooth. Fold in the carrots, pineapple, and walnuts and then pour the
    batter into a greased baking pan and bake for 30-35 minutes. Make sure you allow the cake to cool before frosting
    with cream cheese frosting.</p>

    <center><h2>Sourdough Bread</h2></center>
    <p> A community favorite, boasting a crusty exterior and a soft, airy interior, embodying the classic
        sourdough charm.</p>
    <p> Ingredients: 1 cup sourdough starter, 1 1/2 cups warm water, 4 cups bread flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.</p>    
    <p> Instructions: First, mix the starter, water, and 3 cups of flour in a large bowl. This should create a sticky dough. Next, add salt,
        and remaining flour 1 tablespoon at a time until they are fully incorporated. Then, knead the dough on a floured
        surface for about 15 minutes. Once the kneading is done, place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it, and
        let it rise for about 5 hours. Finally, shape the dough into a loaf, and let it rest for 30 minutes. When you are ready
        to bake, preheat your oven to 450°F and bake for about 30 minutes until it's golden brown.</p>

        <center><h2>Almond Croissants</h2></center>
        <p> A delicate pastry filled with the sweet nutty goodness of almond paste, dusted with
            powdered sugar, and baked to a golden perfection.</p>
        <p> Ingredients: 1 sheet of puff pastry, 1/2 cup of almond paste, 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, 1 egg (for egg wash).</p>    
        <p> Instructions: First, preheat the oven to 375°F. Next, roll out the puff pastry and cut it into triangles. Spread a thin layer of almond
            paste on each triangle. Then, roll each triangle from the base to the tip and curve into a crescent shape. Finally,
            brush with egg wash and sprinkle with powdered sugar, and bake for 15-20 minutes until it’s golden brown.</p>
